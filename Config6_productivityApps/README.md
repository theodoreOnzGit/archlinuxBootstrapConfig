## General

Installing Arch Linux is challenging as it is.

Of the many methods to use to install Arch Linux, 
I have chosen to install it from my 
[existing](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux) 
linux manjaro distribution.

## purpose

this is a config folder with scripts to install productivity
apps including libreoffice, samba and other stuff.
